    "In this notebook we introduce the methodology of using an open source language model (classifier) to classify strings into a set of arbitrary categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "The language model we will use is pretrained on a large dataset (just like the models underpinning OpenAI's recently famous ChatGPT interface). This model in particular has been trained and released by Facebook and has been optimized on the task of classification instead of text generation, but the underlying techniques are similar. It therefore is able to perform the tasks we want directly out-of-the-box without any further tweaking!\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is the act of assigning a probability between one and zero to a (set of) label(s) being applicable to a string of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, the sentence \"The sun is out today.\" seems pretty happy. If a person were asked to give it a score on \"happiness\", they might assign it a score of 90%. But what about the sentence \"It is raining outside..\"? That perhaps should score only 10%, if not lower. The language model we use will be able to draw similar conclusions automatically based on it's understanding of the English language.\n",
